This is very simple game called Pong, it was my first bigger project in C++. The game is designed for two players,
first player can control his paddle with ASWD, W for move up, S for move down, A for counter clockwise rotation and D for clockwise rotation. Analogously for the second player with
controls UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. The user can also turn on simple AI by pressing I the left paddle will be controlled by AI and by pressing O the right paddle will be controlled by AI.
